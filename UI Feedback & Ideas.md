Product:

- need image compression to load faster?
  - Use tinypng.com to reduce image filesize without quality loss
  - Otherwise, look into alternative [rendering types](https://blog.codinghorror.com/progressive-image-rendering/) to avoid top-down loading
- [there is a way to fit images to div size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit)
  - This solves image resolution design restrictions (no more hoping the user's browser is the right resolution)
  - Fill the main bg (if impossible, set page bg to something much darker)
- buttons/links should look better
  - fewer 90 degree angles, more border-radius
  - links without bg/buttons look better in all-caps
- For better immersion: Maybe have more drawers for buttons/controls, to avoid taking up screen real estate until a menu is explicitly opened

Marketing Page:

- font very thin
- main links (top of page) very small
