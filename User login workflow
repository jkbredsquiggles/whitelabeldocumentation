User login workflow defined below

User receives email containing:
  Link to unique virtual venue login page
  Username
  Temporary password

User clicks on link. 

  If not logged in:
    Prompted to enter valid username and valid temporary password and selects 'sign in'
    If first sign in, prompted to create new password.
    User enters new password and selects 'update password'
    User is taken to Virtual Lobby page
      If event is not yet LIVE display 'splash page'
      If event is LIVE, send to active lobby
      If event is OVER, display 'event no longer active' splash page
    
  If logged in:
    User is taken to Virtual Lobby page
       If event is not yet LIVE display 'splash page'
       If event is LIVE, send to active lobby
       If event is OVER, display 'event no longer active' splash page
   
- When they revisit the page after setting the password, what should the "You've failed to login" looklike? Default Cognito behaviour? Which
I think means send you back to the login page with an error?

- What happens if event is OVER but the recording is still available, same as event is LIVE?
